	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long
		overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe. This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with
		a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead
		recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<h3>Cheese Filling</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>15 oz. ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>1 large egg</li>
		<li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
		<li>3 quarters cup Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
		<li>Half teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1 quarter teaspoon pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
		<li>1 yellow onion</li>
		<li>3 quarter lb. ground beef</li>
		<li>3 quarter lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
		<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
		<li>Half cup chicken broth</li>
		<li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Lasagna</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
		<li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<h3>Prep Work</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</b> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Heat olive oil</b> over medium heat and <b>add the diced onions.</b> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This
			allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
		<li><b>Add the ground beef and sausage</b> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so
			that it's very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <b>Add garlic</b> during the
			last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
		<li><b>Add the chicken broth</b> and use a silicone spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the pot. <b>Add the
				marinara suace, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</b> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
			Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to <b>375 degrees.</b></li>
		<li><b>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</b> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached,
			<b>cook the noodles to al dente</b> according to the package instructions. Gently stir with a wooden spoon
			throughout cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. <b>Drain and rinse with cold water</b> until noodles are
			completely cool.
		</li>
		<li>Lay the cooled nooldes flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Assemble</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</b> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <b>add 4 lasagna
				noodles,</b> overlapping them if needed.</li>
		<li><b>Spread 1 third of the ricotta cheese mixture</b> over the noodles, followed by about <b>1 and a half cups of
				meat sauce.</b></li>
		<li>Finish with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixxture,</b> and <b>the rest of the meat
				sauce.</b></li>
		<li><b>Top with 2 and a half cups of Mozzarella cheese.</b></li>
		<li><b>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</b> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent
			the cheee from sticking to it.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Bake</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Bake for 35 minutes.</b> <i>Remove cover</i> and <b>bake for 10 more minutes.</b></li>
		<li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <b>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</b> to allow the layers to
			set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
	</ol>
